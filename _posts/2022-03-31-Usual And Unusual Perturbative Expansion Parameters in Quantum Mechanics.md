## Introduction
This project was undertaken during the 2022/2023 academic year. It was the Senior Honours project for my Mphys degree in Theoretical Physics at the University of Edinburgh. The project start with a brief review of perturbation theory, in particular, it focuses on why perturbation expansions usually diverge. It also introduces some of the mathematical tools necessary to deal with divergent series such as the Padé Summation. Then it explores the 1/N expansion in Quantum Mechanics and it uses in the numerical study of the Energy eigenspectrum of different systems, such as the Yukawa Potential.

## Abstract 
This report briefly introduces perturbation theory and discusses the divergence of perturbation series and how to deal with it using Padé Summation. Then it explores the $\frac{1}{N}$ expansion method in Quantum mechanics. In particular, two different methods to obtain the coefficients of this expansion are explained using the Hydrogen atom as an example. This method is then validated by looking at the results that it provides for different physical systems and comparing them with literature values. Finally, the $\frac{1}{N}$ expansion is used to analyse the energy levels of the Yukawa potential in great detail.
