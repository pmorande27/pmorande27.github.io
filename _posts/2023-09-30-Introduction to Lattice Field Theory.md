## Introduction
This project was undertaken during the Summer of 2023 academic. The project was done under the supervision of Prof Anthony Kennedy, and it was supported by the Summer Scholarship of the School of Physics and Astronomy of the University of Edinburgh.

## Abstract 
This report offers a brief introduction to the main tools in Lattice field theory. It starts with an in-depth
analysis of the theory behind Monte Carlo Methods for numerical integration. After this, the report continues
with an example of how Markov Chain Monte Carlo can be used to analyse the Quantum Harmonic Oscillator
using the Path Integral Formalism. Finally, the report concludes with an introduction to Lattice Field Theory, which uses many of the concepts introduced in the example of the Harmonic Oscillator. The final chapter
includes some calculations of Lattice QCD in the Quenched approximation.
