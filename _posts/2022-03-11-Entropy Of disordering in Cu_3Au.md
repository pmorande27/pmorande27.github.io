## Introduction
This research project was undertaken in the 2021/2022 academic year. It was the final project for the Thermodynamics course that I took as part of my degree in Theoretical Physics at the University of Edinburgh.

This project explores the change in entropy due to order-disorder transition in the Cu3Au alloy. It follows a similar analysis to the one performed by Artur Benisek and Edgar Dachs to measure the entropy change by analysing the Heat capacity of the sample.
## Abstract
Using the data from the Heat Capacities of a Cu3Au initially ordered sample, the effect on the entropy of the order-
disorder (OD) transition is investigated. 

Following a similar analysis to the Artur Benisek and Edgar Dachs (BD) [1]
study, the final results on the total entropy change of the OD phase transition are compared with the ideal entropy of
mixing. It was found that the total entropy change of the disordering transition at 711.11K gave an excess entropy of
âˆ’0.172 (in units of R) when compared to the ideal entropy of mixing
