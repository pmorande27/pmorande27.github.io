## Introduction
This experimental project was undertaken during the 2021/2020 academic year. It was the first laboratory project of the course Experimental Physics 2 that I took as part of my degree in Theoretical Physics at the University of Edinburgh.

This project tries to determine an experimental value of g. It also tries to determine the velocity dependence of Air resitance in a falling polystyrene ball (cuadratic or linear) by using video analysis software to study the motion of the falling ball.
## Abstract
A value of g was found to be 9.814(4) m/s^2 (within 3.5 Ïƒ of the literature value) using
video analysis software to inspect videos of the fall of a steel ball. Using the recording
of the fall of a Polystyrene ball it was found that the Air Resistance on the Polystyrene
ball follows a quadratic dependence on the velocity rather than linear.
